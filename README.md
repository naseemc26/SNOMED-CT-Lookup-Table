<h1>Structured Query Language (SQL) script used to assign prostate biopsy data through the use of SNOMED CT lookup tables</h1>

<p>This GitHub repository contains the structured query language (SQL) script that was used to combine various datasets for the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) clinical terms (CT) morphology (M) and topography (T) code lookup tables developed to assign the following values: (i) diagnosis (benign/malignant), (ii) sub-diagnosis (adenocarcinoma) and (iii) sub-result (inflammation type) for prostate biopsies. A relational database was used to combine the datasets in a single query using a left outer join.</p>

<p>The SNOMED CT codes is a comprehensive clinical terminology system that makes it possible to both input and retrieve coded clinical information. For prostate biopsies, the anatomical pathologist will add the SNOMED T and M codes based on the histological findings. The T code identifies anatomic terms for each organ and the M code describes the microscopic changes observed.</p> 

<p>This work forms part of a thesis titled 'A retrospective analysis of laboratory data to identify clinical practice trends in prostate cancer screening and diagnosis by level of care in the Gauteng Province between 2006 and 2016' submitted to the University of the Witwatersrand (PhD).</p>

<p>This work is also published in the African Journal of Laboaratory Medicine (AJLM).
